    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;

    // console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;

    // console.log({team, players})

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
  
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    team2[3] = 'Lux'; 
    // console.log({players, team2})

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Nikki',
      age: 29
    };

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person; 
    // person2.number = 11; 
    // console.log({person, person2})


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 11});

    // console.log(person, person3)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = {...person};
    person4.favFood = 'pizza';
    // console.log(person4)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const nikki = {
      name: 'nikki',
      age: 29,
      social: {
        fb: 'myFaceBook',
        twit: 'myTwitter'
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, nikki);
    dev.social.twit = 'newTwitter'
    // console.log({nikki, dev})
